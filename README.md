This is a 5 dof robot controller using canopen and odrives

The library requires my canOpen library for mbed to work properly

The controller feathures joint settings including end strokes and predictive limited acceleration braking, generic forward kinematic, parametric inverse kinematic, velocity feed forward generation and torque limiting system.

Path planning system is work in progress
